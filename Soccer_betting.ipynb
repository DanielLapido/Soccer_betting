    "# Problem 2\n",
    "## Daniel Lapido Martínez\n",
    "\n",
    "### Find and describe a problem (realistic or not) where the decision making process requires of the formulation of a linear optimization model with at least 10 decision variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gambling (also known as betting) is the wagering of money or something of value (referred to as \"the stakes\") on an event with an uncertain outcome, with the primary intent of winning money or material goods. One example of that are sports betting which represents a multi-billion dollar business generating huge profits for sportsbooks and casinos worldwide.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for being so profitable is because the odds on display never reflect the true probability or chance of an event occurring (or not occurring). There is always a profit margin added by the bookmaker in these odds, which means that the payout to the successful punter is always less than what they should have received if the odds had reflected the true chances. The bookmaker estimates the true probability or chance of an outcome correctly in order to set the odds on display in such a way that it profits the bookmaker regardless of an event outcome. \n",
    "\n",
    "Through this notebook we will focush on the spanish football league betting industry and my work will consist in implementing in pyomo an approach to football betting that handles risk based on robust optimization. For this purpose I will follow the next steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li> Build a statistical model to predict the probability of an outcome with data from the last seasons.\n",
    "<li> Analize the different betting houses' odds and decide which betting house is better to bet on.\n",
    "<li> Formulate the problem and solve it through robust optimization(worst case view, given the inherent uncertainty of the problem) and decide how much to bet on each game.</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start by solving the problem with linear robust optimization, then we will add some extra conditional constraints, and finally we will try a stochastic programming formulation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Important notes:**\n",
    "<li> I will be using real data that comes from the webpage: <a>https://www.football-data.co.uk/spainm.php</a>. \n",
    "<li> Although it is possible to bet on multitude of events like number of goals, number of corners and so on, I will only consider the outcome of the match.\n",
    "<li> Matches are considered to be <font color=\"red\">simultaneously played </font>.\n",
    "<li> Since the problem is a little bit ambitious, I will make several assumptions to simplify things, especially regarding the statistical model so that we can focush in the optimization problem. </li> \n",

    "#### a) (2 points) Formulate the problem as a linear optimization model (general formulation). Identify the model sets, parameters, variables, objective function and constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a large number of simultaneous bets, we use\n",
    "the overall accuracy of the predictive model to optimize the worst case gain:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify a set of $N$ soccer games on which we want to bet\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fix a maximum budget to spend $B$\n",
    "\n",
    "- The bookmakers’ odds for every game represent the return on a unit stake and denoted $c_{i}$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lets assume that the Poisson model gives good estimates on the probability of each game $p_{i}$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Comparing these probabilities $p_{i}$ with the odds $c_{i}$, we need to decide how to allocate the budget among the different games.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The decision variables $x_{i},  \\ i \\in \\{1, 2,... N \\}$ are the amount of money to bet on game $i$\n",
    "\n",
    "- We have a Budget constraint: $\\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i} \\leq B $\n",
    "\n",
    "- Once a bet $x_{i}$ is set on game $i$, there are two possible outcomes: We either predicted the result correctly and win according to the bookmakers’ odds, or our prediction was wrong and we lose all the money:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{P}_{i}=\n",
    "\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll} \n",
    "(c_{i} - 1)x_{i}, & \\text{if we predict correctly the outcome of game i,}\\\\\n",
    "-x_{i}, & \\text{if we do not predict correctly the outcome}\n",
    "\\end{array} \\right.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The profit of the game is obviously a random variable $(P_{i})$ and the total profit can be obtained as the sum of the profits over all the games: $P = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} P_{i}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is that the outcome of the match is obviously unknown, so we can either be correct or wrong:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y_{i}=\n",
    "\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll} \n",

    "\\end{array} \\right.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This variable clearly belongs to an uncertainty set $\\Omega$ (we do not know how many outcomes we are going to correctly predict, however we are going to assume that we will not be always wrong)\n",
    "\n",
    "This way we can try to optimize the worst case scenario:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\normalsize\n",
    "z = \\underset{x_{i}}{maximize} & \\quad \\normalsize(\\underset{y_{i} \\in \\Omega}{minimize} (\\sum_{i}^{N} x_{i}c_{i}y_{i} - x_{i}) )\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we need to build the uncertainty set $\\Omega$:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the worst case scenario, all $y_{i}$ would be set to zero, however we assume that the model is not completely useless so that it has a 'worst case' accuracy.\n",
    "Lets call this accuracy $\\kappa$, and say that it is $30\\%$ for example. That means that in a worst case scenario the model at least correctly predict the outcome of $\\kappa \\cdot N \\equiv \\Theta$ games. This way we can set the following constraint in the uncertainty set: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_{i} \\geq \\Theta $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we incorporate another constraint that takes into account the probability $p_{i}$ of an event so that it is more difficult to predict wrong an outcome\n",
    "when its predicted probability is very high:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_{i}^{N} p_{i}y_{i} \\geq \\Phi$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally the uncertainty set is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Omega = \\{y \\in \\{0, 1\\}^{N} | \\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_{i} \\geq \\Theta , \\sum_{i}^{N} p_{i}y_{i} \\geq \\Phi  \\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally the parameters $\\Theta$ and $\\Phi$ would be perfectly chosen but in this case we will just set them by hand.\n",
    "\n",
